abstract: A  majority  of  votes  is  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for  legitimate  collective  decisions.   Rather, the legitimacy of majority rule procedures are bounded by the perceptual biases of citizens, both warranted and unwarranted, in ways that systematically deviates from an absolute view of majority rule.  In this article, we explore these bounds and its real-world implications by running a series of survey experiments with EU membership referendums as a case of majority rule.  The experiments are embedded in representative surveys in six European countries (N= 17,956).  We find,  first, that there are two dimensions of majority. The margin of votes in favor and the level of the turnout. Different combinations of vote margin and turnout has different levels of acceptability, conditional on  the  context  of  the  referendum.   Second,  we  find  a status  quo  bias, where it  takes  more  to  accept unwanted change than unwanted status quo.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:   There is broad consensus among Europeans that turnout levels and majority size matter for the legitimacy of a referendum. We further identify that citizens find it easier to accept an outcome that maintains the status quo situation.
