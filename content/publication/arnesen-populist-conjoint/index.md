abstract: What characteristics in politicians are attractive to populist voters and what constitutes atypical populist politician in the eyes of Western European citizens?  These questions have been pertinent for quite some time, but is increasingly relevant to answer at a time where several  European  democracies,  such  as  the  Netherlands  and  France,  are  on  the  brink  of supporting far-right populist politicians that threaten to plunge the European Union into disarray.  Therefore, it is important to understand how people perceive and evaluate populist strategies and attributes. We conduct a conjoint experiment asking a large probability sample (N = 18 000)  of  French,  German,  Dutch,  Norwegian,  Swedish,  and  Icelandic  citizens to  evaluate  profiles  of  politicians  that  randomly  varies  between  eleven  attributes.   These attributes  are  based  on  what  previous  research  have  identified  as  “typical”  for  far  right populist politicians and parties.  We ask 1) which candidate people view as most likely to represent the concerns of ordinary people, and 2) which candidate people, among far right populist voters, would support.  The study has yet to be fielded in all countries, but in this short-paper we will present the results from Norway.
