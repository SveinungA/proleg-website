I study voting behavior and political competition in representative democracies with a special focus on how social identity relationships influence citizens' choices. My work lies at the intersection of Political Economy, Political Behavior, Experimental Methods, and Political Psychology.
In my research I build on strategic and behavioral theories of voting and implement experiments to analyze how individuals evaluate their politicians' performance, when they discriminate in favor of their social group, how they make redistributive allocation decisions, or how they coordinate their choices with their peers when forming electoral coalitions.
