I am a political scientist who takes an interest in political behavior, public opinion, and elections, with a main methodological focus on experimental studies. Currently I lead the projects *Can Fair Decision Making Procedures Increase The Legitimacy of Democracies?*, and *Democratic innovation in practice*. Together with Yvette Peters, I coordinate the research group on Political Behavior and Democracy at the Digital Social Science Core Facilities -- [DIGSSCORE](http://digsscore.uib.no).
