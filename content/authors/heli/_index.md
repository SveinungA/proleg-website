My research interests are judicial behavior, judicial dissent, and public opinion of courts and judges. I focus mainly on the case of the Supreme Court of Norway, but have also researched the Danish Supreme Court. My work mainly consist of quantitative and survey experimental analyses. My most recent publication is "Dissent, Legitimacy, and Public Support for Court Decisions: Evidence from a Survey‚ÄêBased Experiment", Law & Society Review, 53(2): 588-610.
