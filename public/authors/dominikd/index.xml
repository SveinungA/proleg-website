      <description>&lt;p&gt;I study voting behavior and political competition in representative democracies with a special focus on how social identity relationships influence citizens&amp;rsquo; choices. My work lies at the intersection of Political Economy, Political Behavior, Experimental Methods, and Political Psychology.
In my research I build on strategic and behavioral theories of voting and implement experiments to analyze how individuals evaluate their politicians&amp;rsquo; performance, when they discriminate in favor of their social group, how they make redistributive allocation decisions, or how they coordinate their choices with their peers when forming electoral coalitions.&lt;/p&gt;
